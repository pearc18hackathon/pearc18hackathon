# Hackathon at PEARC18: Developing and Applying Best-Practice Protocols
**Date:** Monday, July 23rd  
**Time:** 8:30 AM to 5 PM  
**Location:** Rivers  


## Summary and Focus
For this session at PEARC18, we are piloting a mechanism to help research computing practitioners share and develop solutions with others in the field who share their challenges or interests by providing a hackathon opportunity where interested users can work directly with projects before, during, and after the conference. 

Rather than simply working through tutorials, this hackathon will focus on participants bringing their real-world problems and applications and engaging with project developers, hackathon organizers, and each other to create solutions and share these with the community.

## Theme: Reproducibility and Portability 
The theme of this initial hackathon is reproducible and portable computing. We are featuring several projects around this theme that participants can choose to engage with starting now, at the face-to-face hackathon at PEARC18, and after the conference.

## Projects
Participants are invited to engage with any of the projects listed below. 

**Send email to <pearc18hackathon@gmail.com> to let us know you are planning to join the hackathon and indicate which project(s) you would like to work on.**

You may certainly propose to work on aspects of more than one project. The ideas for each project are our suggestions, but we welcome suggestions from participants. Feel free to send any questions to <pearc18hackathon@gmail.com>.

To help participants gain initial familiarity with a particular project, we provide links to tutorial materials with each project. However, as mentioned, we strongly encourage participants to bring their real-world applications and challenges and use the hackathon as an opportunity to implement something that will benefit them. When possible, we encourage everyone to share their solutions with the community so all can benefit!

### Docker and Singularity
#### Containerize your application and run with Singularity
Do you have an application you'd like to put into a Docker container to run with Singularity on your own HPC system, an XSEDE system, or another resource? Bring your application to the hackathon and let us help you containerize it!

Check out these [container tutorial materials][container camp] to get you started!

### Makeflow and Work Queue
#### Run portable workflows in your own personal cloud with Makeflow and Work Queue
* Get your own real-world workflow (containerized if you wish!) running in the portable workflow manager, Makeflow. 
* Harness all available resources (desktops, clusters, clouds, grids) with the Work Queue lightweight distributed execution system. 
* Get your workflow included in the [official list of Makeflow example workflows][makeflow examples]!

### Bioconda and BioContainers
#### Use and improve Bioconda and BioContainers for portable, reproducible bioinformatics
[Bioconda][bioconda] is a channel of the conda package manager specializing in bioinformatics software. Each bioconda package automatically has a Docker [BioContainer][biocontainers] created for it that is uploaded to [Quay.io][quay.io]. There are a number of ways to engage with Bioconda and BioContainers at the hackathon:
* Add or update a bioinformatics package that you need to Bioconda and BioContainers
* Integrate BioContainers with HPC environments
* Improve tools and documentation for working with BioContainers

---
### Prerequisites
* A laptop with a wifi connection
* Familiarity with Linux command line
* An [XSEDE portal][xsede portal] account
* The following software installed on your laptop
  * SSH client
  * Docker
